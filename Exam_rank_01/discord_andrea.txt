Ciao! I have recently come across the advertisement regarding the room available for rent in your apartment in Dublin, and I would like to express my keen interest. I am a 27-year-old Italian guy currently residing in Rome. I have graduated with top honors and have gained one year of work experience at Accenture.

My stay in Dublin will commence from early September and will last until December 23rd, as I will be pursuing a master's degree in marketing at the Dublin Business School. I consider myself to be a mature, responsible adult who understands the importance of respect and has prior experience with renting in Italy.

I am a quiet individual who values cleanliness and maintaining a tidy living environment. I am committed to creating a pleasant and harmonious atmosphere for all the housemates. I respect others' privacy and I am willing to actively participate in cleaning and shared expenses, ensuring a positive cohabitation experience.

I firmly believe that my background and personal qualities make me an excellent candidate for your offer. I sincerely hope to be considered for this opportunity and I appreciate the time you have dedicated to reviewing my application.

I am available for any further information or to provide any required documentation. I eagerly await your positive response.

Kind regards,

Andre Gazzaruso
